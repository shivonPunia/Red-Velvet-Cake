This is my favorite Red Velvet Cake recipe! The cake is incredibly soft,
moist, buttery, and topped with an easy cream cheese frosting.

Extra Notes :
* Freezing Instructions - Cake will freeze well for up to 3 months, thaw overnight in the refrigerator,
then bring to room temperature. Frosting will also freeze for up to three months, thaw overnight in
the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature and mix well before frosting the cake.
* Buttermilk Substitute - If you don't have any buttermilk, you can use homemade buttermilk substitute.
* To make a 9x13 cake - Spray a 9x13 pan well with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the batter into the
prepared baking pan and spread it around into one even layer, then bake for 35-40 minutes or until
a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
* To make cupcakes: Line 30-32 cavities in muffin pans with cupcake liners, evenly divide the batter
between all of the liners. Bake for 15-18 minute or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the
cupcakes comes out clean. If you prefer fewer cupcakes, you can cut this recipe into half to make 15-16.
